      <Question id="whats-the-difference-between-gnomad-v2-and-v3">
        What&apos;s the difference between gnomAD v2 and v3?
      </Question>
      <Answer>
        <p>
          The gnomAD v2 data set contains data from 125,748 exomes and 15,708 whole genomes, all
          mapped to the GRCh37/hg19 reference sequence. The gnomAD v3 data set contains 71,702 whole
          genomes (and no exomes), all mapped to the GRCh38 reference sequence. Most of the genomes
          from v2 are included in v3.

      <Question id="i-have-identified-a-rare-variant-what-phenotype-data-are-available">
        I have identified a rare variant in gnomAD that I believe is associated with a specific
        clinical phenotype. What phenotype data are available for these individuals?
      </Question>
      <Answer>
        <p>
          Most of the individuals who have contributed data to gnomAD were not fully consented for
          phenotype data sharing, and unfortunately at this time we are typically unable to provide
          any information about the clinical status of variant carriers. We have made every effort
          to exclude individuals with severe pediatric diseases from the gnomAD data set, and
          certainly do not expect our data set to be <em>enriched</em> for such individuals, but we
          typically cannot rule out the possibility that some of our participants do actually suffer
          from your disease of interest.

        Can I get access to individual-level genotype data from gnomAD?
      </Question>
      <Answer>
        <p>
          Many of the samples in gnomAD have individual-level sequencing data deposited in{' '}
          <ExternalLink href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap">dbGaP</ExternalLink>, and these can

            applying through that repository
          </ExternalLink>
          . However, many other samples come from unpublished cohorts or from samples not in dbGaP.
          There is not currently any mechanism to systematically obtain individual-level genotype
          data from the database as a whole.

      <Question id="why-is-a-particular-variant-found-in-some-versions-of-exac-gnomad-but-not-others">
        Why is a particular variant found in some versions of ExAC/gnomAD but not others?
      </Question>
      <Answer>
        <p>
          Likely because of differences between the projects in sample inclusion and variant quality
          control.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sample QC: Not all data from previous call sets is included in each gnomAD release. Most
          of the samples from prior releases are included during the initial joint calling; however,
          we make changes to our sample QC process in each release, which always results in the
          removal of some samples that previously passed. For instance, approximately 10% of the
          samples in ExAC are missing from gnomAD, so we expect some variants in ExAC, particularly
          those that were found at low frequencies, to be absent in gnomAD.
        </p>

        <p>
          Variant QC: Some variants present in previous releases may now be filtered because we used
          new filtering strategies. In particular, starting with gnomAD, we filter each allele
          separately whereas variant QC was done at the site-level (chromosome, position) in ExAC.
          We also continuously work on improving our filtering strategy: for instance, we used a
          combination of a random forest classifier and hard filters (only high-confidence
          genotypes, inbreeding coefficient &ge; 0.3) for gnomAD v2 rather than the standard GATK
          site-level Variant Quality Score Recalibration (VQSR) used for ExAC.

      <Question id="should-i-switch-to-the-latest-version-of-gnomad">
        Should I switch to the latest version of gnomAD?
      </Question>
      <Answer>
        <p>
          The gnomAD v2 call set contains fewer whole genomes than v3, but also contains a very
          large number of exomes that substantially increase its power as a reference in coding
          regions. Therefore gnomAD v2 is still our recommended dataset for most coding regions
          analyses. However, gnomAD v3 represents a very large increase in the number of genomes,
          and will therefore be a much better resource if your primary interest is in non-coding
          regions or if your coding region of interest is poorly captured in the gnomAD exomes (this
          can be assessed from the coverage plots in the browser).
        </p>

        <p>
          Another consideration when choosing which dataset to use is the ancestry of the samples
          you are interested in. gnomAD v3 contains a substantially larger number of African
          American samples than v2 (exomes and genomes combined) and provides allele frequencies in
          the Amish population for the first time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, gnomAD v3 was mapped to GRCh38, so if your data is also on this build it then it
          probably makes sense to switch to v3. There is also a{' '}

          onto GRCh38 available. We plan to produce a larger GRCh38 aligned exome callset in 2020.

      <Question id="how-do-evaluate-variants-in-a-gene-that-has-a-pseudogene">
        How do I evaluate variants in a gene that has a pseudogene? Were any steps taken to
        distinguish the gene from the pseudogene?
      </Question>
      <Answer>
        <p>
          Short read sequencing can produce mapping issues when a gene has a highly homologous
          pseudogene. Many variants in such genes (e.g. <Link to="/gene/PRSS1">PRSS1</Link>) will be
          filtered due to low mapping quality or deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium; the
          remaining variants should be interpreted with caution. The gnomAD pipeline does not apply
          any special filters to regions with a highly similar pseudogene.

        How was the expected number of variants determined?
      </Question>
      <Answer>
        <p>
          We used a depth corrected probability of mutation for each gene to predict the expected
          variant counts. More details can be found in the{' '}
          <ExternalLink href="https://broad.io/gnomad_lof">gnomAD flagship paper</ExternalLink>.
          Note that the expected variant counts for bases with a median depth &lt;1 were removed

      <Question id="which-variants-are-included-in-the-observed-counts">
        Which variants are included in the observed counts?
      </Question>
      <Answer>
        <p>
          We included single nucleotide changes that occurred in the canonical transcript that were
          found at a frequency of &lt;0.1%, passed all filters, and at sites with a median depth
          &ge;1. The counts represent the number of unique variants and not the allele count of
          these variants.

        Why are there fewer variants in the constraint table than displayed on the gene page?
      </Question>
      <Answer>
        <p>
          We only included variants that were found in the canonical transcript of the gene. On the
          gene page, variants found in all transcripts are displayed. Additionally, both observed
          and expected variant counts were removed for sites with a median depth &lt;1.

      <Question id="why-are-constraint-metrics-missing-for-this-gene">
        Why are constraint metrics missing for this gene?
      </Question>
      <Answer>
        <p>
          Genes that were outliers in certain assessments will not have constraint metrics. Please
          note that these assessments were applied to the canonical transcripts of the genes. If a
          gene was not annotated as a protein-coding gene in Gencode v19, we did not calculate
          constraint. In addition, if a canonical transcript was missing a &quot;Met&quot; at the
          start, it was considered malformed and not evaluated for constraint metrics. The following
          list describes the reason names given in the constraint_flag column of the{' '}

          No. We were not given permission from NHLBI to include individuals from several of the

        <p>
          Please note that cohorts vary in how they report age (some report the age at diagnosis,
          others report the age of last visit, etc), so the ages associated with the gnomAD data can
          be thought of as the last known age of the individual. Information on age was not
          available for all samples. We have age data for 85,462 exome samples and 11,242 genome
          samples.

          that we used different combination of metrics (mostly due to their availability) for the
          different gnomAD datasets (see below for details). The F-stat was computed for each sample
          using high-confidence QC SNVs (bi-allelic SNVs, LD-pruned to r<sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.1, with
          allele frequency &gt; 0.1% and call rate &gt; 99%) on non-pseudoautosomal regions
          (non-PAR) of the X chromosome. The normalized coverage was computed as the mean coverage
          on sex chromosomes / mean coverage on chromosome 20. The exact metrics and threshold used
          for sex assignment were as follows:

        How is ancestry determined for gnomAD samples?

      <Answer>
        <p>
          We use principal components analysis (PCA,{' '}
          <ExternalLink href="https://hail.is/docs/0.2/methods/genetics.html#hail.methods.hwe_normalized_pca">

          ) on a set of high quality variants (LD-pruned (r2 &lt; 0.1), autosomal, bi-allelic SNVs
          with allele frequency &gt; 0.1% and call rate &gt; 99%) to determine the ancestry of the
          samples. For each release, PCA is run on the entire dataset (combining exomes and genomes
          for gnomAD v2) at once, excluding first and second degree relatives. We then train a
          random forest classifier on samples with previously known population labels using the PCs
          as features. We assign ancestry to all samples for which the probability of that ancestry
          is &gt; 90% according to the random forest model. All other samples are assigned the other
          ancestry (oth). Detailed numbers for gnomAD v2 and v3 are given below.
        </p>

        <h4>gnomAD v2</h4>

        <p>
          For gnomAD v2, we used 94,176 training sites that were shared by exomes and genomes and
          passed our high quality thresholds for PCA.
        </p>

        <p>
          The random forest model was trained using a set of 52,768 samples for which we knew the
          ancestry. Because there were only 31 South Asian (sas) samples among the genomes, we
          manually assigned these to other (oth) ancestry as well due to their low number.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sub-continental ancestry was computed for European and East Asian samples using the same
          strategy. The reason for computing sub-continental labels for these two global ancestry
          groups only was (1) the presence of reliable labels of known sub-population for large
          enough samples of the data, and (2) the resulting PCA was convincingly splitting the data
          into separate clusters that matched our known labels.
        </p>

        <h4>gnomAD v3</h4>

        <p>
          To select the variants for PCA, we lifted-over the high-quality variants used for gnomAD
          v2, as well as a set of 5k variants widely used for quality control of GWAS data defined
          by Shaun Purcell. We then took these variants and applied our quality threshold, leading
          to 94,148 high quality variants for PCA.
        </p>

        <p>
          The random forest model was trained based on 17,906 samples with known ancestry and 14,949
          samples for which we had a population label from gnomAD v2.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sub-continental population assignment has not been performed for gnomAD v3 at this time.

          ) to determine the ancestry of the samples. First, a set 94k LD-pruned (r2 &lt; 0.1),
          autosomal, bi-allelic SNVs with allele frequency &gt; 0.1% and call rate &gt; 99% in both
          exomes and genomes was extracted. Then PCA was run on both exomes and genomes excluding
          first and second degree relatives. We then trained a random forest classifier using 52k
          samples with previously known population labels. We then leveraged a set of 52,768 samples
          for which we knew the ancestry to train a random forests classifier using the PCs as
          features. We assigned ancestry to all samples for which the probability of that ancestry
          was &gt; 90% according to the random forest model. All other samples were assigned the
          other ancestry (oth). In addition, the 31 South Asian (sas) samples among the genomes were
          assigned to other as well due to their low number. Sub-continental ancestry was computed
          for European and East Asian samples using the same strategy. The reason for computing for
          these two global ancestry groups only was (1) the presence of reliable labels of known
          sub-population for large enough samples of the data, and (2) the resulting PCA was

        How many males/females have this variant? Can it be assumed that hemizygous variants come
        only from males?
      </Question>
      <Answer>
        <p>
          Sex for genomes was determined by X heterozygosity. Sex for exomes was based on both X
          heterozygosity and Y coverage. Information on allele frequency for males and females for
          each variant is provided in the population frequencies table on the browser and in the
          INFO fields of our VCF files (example: AC_male, AC_female, AF_female, AC_fin_male). If a
          variant is on the X chromosome, it can be assumed that hemizygous variants come from males
          and homozygous variants in non-PAR regions come from females.

          minimize inflation of rare variant frequencies. We always prioritize samples with higher
          quality metrics. In gnomAD v2, this was done on exomes and genomes combined, prioritizing

      </Question>
      <Answer>
        <p>
          First, we do not continuously update the dbSNP rsIDs displayed in the browser, so there
          will be some differences the databases and dbSNP depending on versions been used. The
          dbSNP version used are:
        </p>

        <p>
          Several other classes of problem relates to fundamental issues with dbSNP. dbSNP rsIDs do
          not provide robustly unique identifiers as the rsIDs are based on genomic position and are
          allele-independent. We generally suggest not using these identifiers at all; if a user is
          interested in a particular variant we encourage searching for it by chromosome, position,
          and allele rather than rsID.

        <p>
          A gene search in the new browser will return variants in the CDS regions of the gene or
          within 75 base pairs of a CDS region. This behavior means that not all intronic or UTR
          variants will appear when doing a gene search or downloading the CSV tables, leading to
          fewer variants being displayed on the browser than what is present in the downloadable
          VCFs (which will contain all variants). You can also do a region search (example:{' '}

        Why are some variants depleted for homozygotes/out of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE)?
      </Question>
      <Answer>
        <p>
          It has recently come to our attention that a number of genotypes with a high proportion of
          alternate allele reads (Allele Balance; AB &ge; 90%) are being called as heterozygous when
          they may be homozygous. This deflates the number of reported homozygotes, and is
          especially apparent at common variants and more so for long insertions and deletions. This
          will affect frequency estimates and especially the calculation of Hardy-Weinberg
          Equilibrium. Use caution when interpreting the frequencies of these variants. We are
          currently flagging these variants in the gnomAD browser, and working on a longer-term fix.

      <Answer>
        <h4>gnomAD v3</h4>

        <p>
          Coverage was computed using all 71,702 gnomAD v3 samples from their GVCFs . The gVCFs were
          produced using a 3-bin blocking scheme:
        </p>

          <ListItem>Reference genotype quality &lt; Q20</ListItem>
          <ListItem>Reference genotype quality &ge; Q20</ListItem>
        </List>

        <p>
          The coverage was binned by quality using the thresholds above and the median coverage
          value for each of the resulting coverage blocks was used to compute the coverage metrics
          presented in the browser.
        </p>

        <p>
          Coverage was computed for all callable bases in the genome (all non-N bases, minus
          telomeres and centromeres).
        </p>

        <h4>gnomAD v2</h4>

        <p>
          Coverage was calculated separately for exomes and genomes on a ~10% subset of the samples
          using the <ExternalLink href="https://www.htslib.org/">samtools</ExternalLink> depth tool.
          The base quality threshold was set to 10 for the -q option and the mapping quality
          threshold set to 20 for the -Q option. It is calculated per base of the respective calling
          intervals, includes sites with zero depth (-a flag), and is capped at 100x for a given
          sample and base pair. Mean coverage is then plotted on the browser. The numbers in columns
          1, 5, 10, etc of our downloadable coverage files refer to the fraction of samples with a
          depth of coverage of at least 1 read, 5 reads, 10 reads, etc. for the given chromosome and

          because it is actually absent in all gnomAD samples is to check the coverage at that base
          position. You can obtain coverage files from our downloads page. If you are using the
          browser, a region search will still display coverage plots for zero-variant sites, which
          can help distinguish between sites that lack variants and sites that could not be called
          because of a lack of coverage.

        Why does a variant show a large drop in AN compared to surrounding variants in gnomAD v2?
      </Question>
      <Answer>
        <p>
          Sometimes a large apparent drop in AN can occur because a variant was called in only
          genome samples. If surrounding variants were called in exomes or both exomes and genomes,
          the AN values for these variants are higher, making it appear that there is a sudden drop
          and rise in AN. Although the AN is likely consistently high across the given region for
          exomes, if we only have explicit variant calls for the genome data, we can only speak to
          our reference confidence for those samples.

        What are your calling intervals? What intervals are used for the genomes coding-only files?
      </Question>
      <Answer>
        <p>
          The calling intervals for our exomes include the bait-covered regions &plusmn;50 bp. The
          following exome calling intervals were used to generate the genome coding-only files in
          gnomAD v2.
