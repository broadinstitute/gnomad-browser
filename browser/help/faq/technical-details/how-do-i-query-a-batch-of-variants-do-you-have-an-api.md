question: 'How do I query a batch of variants? Do you have an API?'
---

We currently do not have a way to submit batch queries on the browser, but we are actively working on developing a public API for gnomAD. We currently maintain a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) API for internal use and groups can contact us if they want permission to use this API until a more robust public solution is launched.

You can also obtain information on all variants from the VCFs and Hail Tables available on our [downloads page](/downloads).
