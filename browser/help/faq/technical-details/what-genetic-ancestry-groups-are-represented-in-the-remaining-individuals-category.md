question: 'What genetic ancestry groups are represented in the "remaining individuals" category?'
---

Individuals were classified as "remaining individuals" if they did not unambiguously cluster with the major populations (i.e. `afr`, `ami`, `amr`, `asj`, `eas`, `fin`, `mid`, `nfe`, `sas`) in a principal component analysis (PCA).
