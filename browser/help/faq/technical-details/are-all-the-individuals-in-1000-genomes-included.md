question: 'Are all the individuals in 1000 Genomes included?'
---

The majority of samples from the 1000 Genomes Project for which exome sequencing is available were included in v4.1. Whole genome sequencing from 3,202 subjects from the 1000 Genomes Project was included in gnomAD v3.1, and which are now in v4.1 genomes, though some were filtered out by our QC pipeline. A [fully genotyped callset](/downloads#v3-hgdp-1kg) containing individual genotypes for these data is available.
