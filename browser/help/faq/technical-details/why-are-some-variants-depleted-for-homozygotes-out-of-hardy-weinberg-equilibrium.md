question: 'Why are some variants depleted for homozygotes/out of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE)?'
---

Prior to v3.1, a number of genotypes with a high proportion of alternate allele reads (Allele Balance; AB >= 90%) were being called as heterozygous when they may be homozygous. This deflated the number of reported homozygotes, and was especially apparent at common variants and more so for long insertions and deletions. This affected frequency estimates and especially the calculation of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium; see our [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/784157) for more details.

The issue is now fixed for new gVCFs generated by HaplotypeCaller moving forward. However, for v4.0 and v4.1, the majority of variant calls were already generated using an uncorrected version of HaplotypeCaller. We therefore made an adjustment to heterozygous genotypes with highly skewed allele balance (>0.9) at common variant sites (>0.01 AF), setting these genotypes to homozygous alternate genotypes. This change is reflected in the aggregate allele frequencies, allele numbers, and allele counts displayed on the browser as well as in the genotype data released for the gnomAD HGDP and 1000 Genomes callset.
