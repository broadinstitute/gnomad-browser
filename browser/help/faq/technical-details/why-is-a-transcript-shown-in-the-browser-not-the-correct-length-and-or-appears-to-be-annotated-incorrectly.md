question: 'Why is a transcript shown in the browser not the correct length and/or appears to be annotated incorrectly?'

Annotations may have changed depending on the version of GENCODE used (such as changing from a non-coding to a protein-coding gene, or having a different transcript length). For information on the VEP and GENCODE annotation versions used please see our [annotation section](/help/vep)
