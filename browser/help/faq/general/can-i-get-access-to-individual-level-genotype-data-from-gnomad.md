question: 'Can I get access to individual-level genotype data from gnomAD?'
---

**The gnomAD project is not allowed to provide any individual-level data under any circumstances**. However, many of the samples in gnomAD have individual-level sequencing data deposited in [dbGaP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) or the UKBB for which access can be requested. In addition, a fully genotyped [callset](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/downloads#v3-hgdp-1kg) from the Human Genome Diversity Project and 1000 Genomes Project is available. However, many other samples come from unpublished cohorts or from samples not in dbGaP. No mechanisms currently exist to systematically obtain individual-level genotype data from the database as a whole.
