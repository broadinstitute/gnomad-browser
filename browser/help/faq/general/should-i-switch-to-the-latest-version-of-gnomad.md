question: 'Should I switch to the latest version of gnomAD?'
---

With 730,947 exomes and 76,215 genomes, the gnomAD v4.1 call set is the largest of all the gnomAD versions. It also contains nearly all data from prior versions (v2 and v3) except a small number of samples excluded due to data quality and updated sample filtering pipelines. Since gnomAD v4.1 is mapped to GRCh38, if you havenâ€™t switched to GRCh38, now is the time!
