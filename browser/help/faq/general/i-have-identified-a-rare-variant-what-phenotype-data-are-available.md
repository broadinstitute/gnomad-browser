question: 'I have identified a rare variant in gnomAD that I believe is associated with a specific clinical phenotype. What phenotype data are available for these individuals?'
---

The gnomAD resource does not currently have permission, access, or staffing to investigate the availability of phenotype data for individual samples nor the consent status to share that data. As such, at this time we are typically unable to provide any information about the clinical status of a sample in gnomAD. We have made every effort to exclude individuals with severe pediatric diseases from the gnomAD data set, and certainly do not expect our data set to be _enriched_ for such individuals, but we typically cannot rule out the possibility that a given participant has a disease of interest.
