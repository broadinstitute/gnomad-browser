The gnomAD v4.0 data set contains 730,947 exomes plus the 76,215 genomes previously called gnomAD v3.1, all mapped to the GRCh38/hg38 reference sequence.

The gnomAD v2.1 data set contained data from 125,748 exomes and 15,708 whole genomes, all mapped to the GRCh37/hg19 reference sequence. Most of the data from v2 are included in v4.0.
