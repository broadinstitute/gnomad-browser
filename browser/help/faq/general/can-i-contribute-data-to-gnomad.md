question: 'Can I contribute data to gnomAD?'
---

Please [contact us](mailto:gnomad@broadinstitute.org) if you are a study investigator and are interested in contributing exome or genome sequencing data to the gnomAD resource. We are particularly interested in increasing the diversity included in gnomAD to improve the resource. We have limited funding for data reprocessing of externally sequenced samples for use in gnomAD and therefore we prioritize reprocessing of datasets composed of individuals from historically underrepresented populations and other populations not well-represented in gnomAD (e.g. Middle East).

Please be aware that there are a number of challenges associated with incorporating external datasets into gnomAD. To produce the high quality, unified gnomAD dataset, we are unable to directly add externally generated VCFs to the gnomAD dataset and need to process all CRAM/BAM files in a uniform manner at the Broad Institute. This requires data reprocessing, including regulatory review, transfer of raw data to the Broad Institute, remapping of raw data, generation of a VCF and providing requested metadata (i.e. sex, age, race/ethnicity/ancestry).

Please also note that given the importance of gnomAD to the clinical genetics community to diagnose patients with monogenic disease, we do not include cohorts recruited for severe pediatric disease or their first-degree relatives, allowing the database to largely represent the general population.

Soon, we will begin to explore working with other sites to create a federated gnomAD. This would include a small number of sites outside the US that are willing to contribute data but are not allowed to send the raw data to the Broad Institute. In this case, if the site has an experienced computational team able to work alongside the gnomAD technical team, we would guide the sites to follow gnomAD pipelines and best practices to generate aggregate data that can then be shared with the gnomAD team for incorporation into a federated gnomAD. Please contact us if this option is of interest as we explore the feasibility of this approach.

All investigators who contribute data to gnomAD join the gnomAD Consortium. See our [Memorandum of Understanding](/mou) for more details on Consortium membership.
