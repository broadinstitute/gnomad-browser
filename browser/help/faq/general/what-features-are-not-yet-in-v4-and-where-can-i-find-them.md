question: 'What features are not yet in v4 and where can I find them?'
---

The v4.0 release is a minimum viable product (MVP) release, which allows us to get the most critical piece of the gnomAD database, high quality aggregate allele frequencies, to our users as soon as possible. It also means that a few of the existing features found in v2 or v3 are not yet included in v4 but **will be coming soon**.

Below is a list of all features not included in the v4 MVP and where to find them in our past datasets until we are able to add them to v4:
