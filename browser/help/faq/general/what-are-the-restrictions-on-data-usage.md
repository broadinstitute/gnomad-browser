question: 'What are the restrictions on data usage?'
---

These usage guidelines are based on goodwill. They are not a legal contract, but we request that you follow these guidelines if you use our data.

There are no restrictions or embargoes on the publication of results derived from the gnomAD database. However, we encourage people to [check with the consortium](mailto:gnomad@broadinstitute.org) before embarking on large-scale analyses, to see if we already have something currently underway that overlaps with your plans.

The primary data from the gnomAD exomes and genomes are available free of restrictions under the [Creative Commons Zero Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) . This means that you can use it for any purpose without legally having to give attribution. However, we request that you actively acknowledge and give attribution to the gnomAD project, and link back to the relevant page, wherever possible. Attribution supports future efforts to release other data. It also reduces the amount of "orphaned data", helping retain links to authoritative sources.

Screenshots of the website may also be used without restriction. As with any use of gnomAD data, we request that you actively acknowledge and give attribution to the gnomAD project, and link back to the relevant page, wherever possible.
