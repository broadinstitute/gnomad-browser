question: 'What data were used to develop the variant co-occurrence predictions?'
---

We used the exome sequencing samples from gnomAD v2.1 (n = 125,748; GRCh37) to estimate haplotype frequencies that were then used to statistically infer the phase of a pair of variants in the same gene. At this time, no genome sequencing data are included in the analyses and our predictions are based on the GRCh37 genome build.
