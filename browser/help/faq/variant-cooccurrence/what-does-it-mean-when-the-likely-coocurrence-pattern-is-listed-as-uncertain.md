question: 'What does it mean when the likely co‑occurrence pattern is listed as “Uncertain”?'
---

When the probability of a pair of variants being in _trans_ (P<sub>trans</sub>) falls in between the thresholds we set for variant pairs in _cis_ (P<sub>trans</sub> ≤ 0.02) or in _trans_ (P<sub>trans</sub> ≥ 0.55), we cannot confidently infer the phase. We therefore refer to the likely co-occurrence pattern as “uncertain” in these cases.
