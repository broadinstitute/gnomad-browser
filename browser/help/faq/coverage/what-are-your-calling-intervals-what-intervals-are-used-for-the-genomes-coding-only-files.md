question: 'What are your calling intervals? What intervals are used for the genomes coding-only files?'
---

The calling intervals for our exomes include the bait-covered regions ±50 bp. For v4, our exome calling regions file includes information about the two sets of calling intervals used for v4 samples: Broad exome calling intervals and UK Biobank exome calling intervals.
