question: 'Why are there fewer variants in the constraint table than displayed on the gene page?'
---

We only included single nucleotide variants that were found in the MANE Select (v3 and v4 on GRCh38) or canonical (ExAC and v2 on GRCh37/hg19) transcript of the gene. On the gene page, variants found in all transcripts are displayed. Additionally, both observed and expected variant counts were removed for sites with a median depth < 30.
