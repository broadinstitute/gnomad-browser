---

The markers to the right of the individual tissue pext score tracks show the mean expression of the gene's transcripts in each tissue. Larger markers correspond to higher expression. Hovering over one of the markers shows the mean transcript expression in the tissue as well as the transcript most expressed in the tissue and its expression.

Transcript expression was calculated from [GTEx v7](https://gtexportal.org/home/datasets#datasetDiv6) [RNA-Seq data](https://gtexportal.org/home/datasets#filesetFilesDiv64). For more information about GTEx, visit [gtexportal.org](https://gtexportal.org).
