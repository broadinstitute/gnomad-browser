The mitochondrial DNA haplogroup of each individual was classified using HaploGrep. Individuals were grouped by their top-level haplogroup assignment, and the allele frequency and counts within each of these branches of the mitochondrial phylogenetic tree (that have at least 1 individual present in gnomAD) are shown. Haplogroup nomenclature is per [van Oven et al Human Mutation 2009](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/humu.20921).  We note that variants displayed are relative to the GRCh38 reference genome, which contains the rCRS mitochondrial sequence which belongs to haplogroup H2a2a1 (within the top-level haplogroup H).

The origin of each top-level haplogroup can be categorized into one of three broad super-populations â€“ African, Asian, and European. Due to human migration, the same haplogroup may be present in multiple populations. Additionally, mitochondrial haplogroups are only a marker of maternal ancestry, and not necessarily concordant with ancestry estimated from nuclear genome analyses. Detailed numbers on the proportion of each haplogroup within each population for gnomAD v2/v3 (as determined from nuclear variant analyses) are available in the FAQ ["What is the distribution of haplogroups in gnomAD v3.1?"](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/help/what-is-the-distribution-of-haplogroups-in-gnomad-v3-1).
