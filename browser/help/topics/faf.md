title: 'Filtering allele frequency'
---

This annotation can be used for filtering variants by allele frequency against a disease-specific threshold that can be set for each disease (e.g. BA1 in the 2015 ACMG/AMP guidelines). In this case the filtering allele frequency (FAF) is the maximum credible genetic ancestry group AF (e.g. the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI)). If the FAF is above the disease-specific threshold, then the observed AC is not compatible with pathogenicity. See http://cardiodb.org/allelefrequencyapp/ and [Whiffin _et al._ 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/gim201726) for additional information.

Note that this annotation contains filtering allele frequency information from the genetic ancestry group with the highest **FAF**, not the filtering allele frequency information calculated on the genetic ancestry group with the highest **AF**.

The filtering allele frequency calculation only includes non-bottlenecked genetic ancestry groups: we did not calculate this metric on the Amish (`ami`), Ashkenazi Jewish (`asj`), European Finnish (`fin`), Middle Eastern (`mid`), and "Remaining Individuals" (`rmi`) groups.

On the browser, this annotation is directly available on the variant page. In the VCF and Hail Tables, this annotation (abbreviated "`faf`") is computed globally and for each genetic ancestry group. Filtering allele frequencies (FAFs) for each genetic ancestry group specific are listed separately with 95% and 99% CIs.

### <a name="grpmax"></a>Group maximum allele frequency

This annotation (abbreviated "`grpmax`") contains allele frequency information (AC, AN, AF, homozygote count) for the non-bottlenecked genetic ancestry groups with the highest **AF**.

For gnomAD v4, this calculation excludes Amish (`ami`), Ashkenazi Jewish (`asj`), European Finnish (`fin`), Middle Eastern (`mid`), and "Remaining Individuals" (`rmi`) groups. For gnomAD v2, this calculation excludes Ashkenazi Jewish (`asj`), European Finnish (`fin`), and "Remaining Individuals" (`rmi`) groups.
