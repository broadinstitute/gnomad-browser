title: 'Genotype quality Q score'
---

The genotype quality **Q** score ranges from 0 (low quality) to 1 (high quality) and is based on the ratio between the allele size and the width of the confidence interval reported by ExpansionHunter. It is described in more detail in [[Jam 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10028971)] and is evaluated in [[Weisburd 2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37214979/)].
