The x-axis represents the number of repeats as detected by ExpansionHunter. The y-axis represents the number of alleles found to have that particular number of repeats. Each genotype contributes 2 counts to the distribution, 1 for the long allele and 1 for the short allele, except at TR loci on the X chromosome where male genotypes are hemizygous and so contribute only 1 count.
