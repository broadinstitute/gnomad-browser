Read visualizations were generated using [REViewer](https://www.illumina.com/science/genomics-research/articles/reviewer-alignments-short-reads-long-repeat.html). They are presented here in order from longest to shortest allele size. For additional information and examples on how to interpret these images, see the [gnomAD STR blog post](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/news/2022-01-the-addition-of-short-tandem-repeat-calls-to-gnomad/) as well as [Dolzhenko 2022](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.20.465046).
