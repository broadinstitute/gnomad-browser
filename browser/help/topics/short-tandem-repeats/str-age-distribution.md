title: 'Age Distribution'
---

The x-axis represents the number of repeats detected by ExpansionHunter. The y-axis represents the individualsâ€™ age. Please note that cohorts vary in how they report age (e.g. age at enrollment, age at diagnosis, age of last visit, etc.), so these ages can be thought of as the last reported age of the individual. The Age Distribution includes only a subset of the alleles present in the Allele Size Distribution because age information was only available for approximately half of the individuals in the dataset.
