The x-axis represents the number of repeats detected by ExpansionHunter in the long allele of each individual at this locus. The y-axis represents the number of repeats in the short allele. Each individual contributes 1 count to the heatmap. For STR loci on the X chromosome, hemizygous genotypes are displayed on the diagonal as if they are homozygous. Mousing over a bin shows the number of individuals it represents.
