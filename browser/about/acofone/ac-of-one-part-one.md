## Executive Summary

The vast majority of variants being discovered within large population datasets – and in particular those with the greatest functional impact – are extremely rare. Some genomic data generating programs limit the ability to share allele counts (AC) below a certain threshold (e.g. below 20 in the All of Us Research Program unless an exception is granted). However, sharing summary statistics for all variants, including those found only in a single individual, is critical for scientific progress and discovery. Obscuring information about this rare variation would be reasonable if the risks to participants were large, but the experiences of many other large genomics initiatives illustrate that the actual risks to privacy are quite small.

## Most variants being discovered in genomic population datasets are extremely rare

Precision medicine research implicitly requires exploring individual genetic variants within the human genome. Because every individual’s genome harbors extensive unique variation, the vast majority of variants in any large scale study – and especially those novel variants – tend to be extremely rare. In fact, our expectation is that the majority of unique variants in any large genomic dataset will be present in at most 1 or 2 participants. It is therefore paramount that information about this critical class of variation is distributed to the research community.

[This paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature19057) from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) highlights the fact that most variants from a large diverse dataset will be rare<sup>1</sup>. Figure 1c, copied below, shows that more than 50% of the variants in the exome are singletons, present in only 1 individual. Similarly, unpublished data from the gnomAD version 4.1 exomes (restricting analysis to high quality variants in canonical transcripts) also shows that most variants discovered across over 730k individuals are rare.
