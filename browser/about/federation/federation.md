The gnomAD project has demonstrated the value of aggregating diverse allele frequency reference datasets that are processed consistently and represented in a single resource. However, this centralized approach is not feasible for all datasets, as some data cannot be exported from their local environments for security, policy or legal reasons. In order to incorporate these datasets into gnomAD, we have launched the Federated gnomAD project. This project includes participating sites from across the globe (site descriptions below). All sites involved in Federated gnomAD plan to process and quality control their data according to gnomAD best practices and freely share aggregate allele frequency data with the primary gnomAD database. All of the summary data will be aggregated with the primary gnomAD data in the gnomAD browser for ease of use by the wider scientific and clinical community.
