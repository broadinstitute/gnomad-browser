We request that any use of data obtained from the gnomAD browser cite [the gnomAD flagship paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06045-0) and any online resources that include the data set provide a link to the browser. For use of the SV data, we request that you cite [this paper](https://broad.io/gnomad_sv).

To cite a gnomAD version prior to publication, we recommend using this format:

> gnomAD (vX.X, Y individuals, released on MM/DD/YY) (most recent flagship paper).

For example, to cite gnomAD v4.1:

> gnomAD (v4.1, 807,162 individuals, released on 04/19/2024) (Chen et al., 2023).

There is no need to include us as authors on your manuscript, unless we contributed specific advice or analysis for your work.
