## OurDNA Browser Ethics Policy

Data included in the OurDNA Browser database [has received rigorous ethical review and approval](/ethics-contact), guided by the principles of the [National Statement on ethical conduct in human research](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/about-us/publications/national-statement-ethical-conduct-human-research-2023) (‘National Statement’). The guidelines under the National Statement have been developed jointly by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), the Australian Research Council (ARC) and Universities Australia.

The ARC, NHMRC and Universities Australia have also developed a supplementary guide designed to support institutions and researchers to implement and comply with the National Statement, including the [Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/about-us/publications/australian-code-responsible-conduct-research-2018). All data generation, analysis and aggregation Is conducted in accordance with participants’ consent choices.

## Expectations For Data Use

This database contains allele frequency information across diverse population samples. While we make this resource available to encourage scientific discovery, we emphasise that appropriate interpretation requires specialised expertise in population genetics, statistical genetics, and clinical genomics.

Furthermore, we invite all users to share in the core CPG value: *We remember that our data comes from people*. We aim to centre community interests in all uses of the data. [Read more about how communities have participated in the building of the OurDNA Browser](https://populationgenomics.org.au/about-us/resources/publications/).


### Intended Users

This resource is designed for researchers and clinicians with formal training in genetics and genomics who understand the limitations of population genetic data.

### Important Limitations

1. **Biology is complex**: Most human traits and diseases are influenced by hundreds or thousands of genetic variants working together, in combination with environmental factors. Single variants rarely predict meaningful differences in physical traits or disease risk.

2. **Context matters**: The effect of any single genetic variant depends on the broader genetic background in which it exists. A variant's association with a trait in one ancestry group may not translate to similar effects in another.

3. **Many studies contain bias**: Published associations between variants and traits often derive from studies with limited population diversity and sample sizes, which makes generalisations across populations scientifically unsound.

4. **Population labels are overly simplistic**: The ancestry categories used in this database are practical groupings, not biologically distinct entities. Human genetic variation is continuous across populations, and these categories oversimplify this complexity.

5. **Statistical vs. clinical significance**: Statistical associations do not necessarily indicate biological mechanisms or clinical relevance.

### Prohibited Uses
This data should not be used to:

* Make any attempt to identify individual research participants from whom the data were obtained

* Infer that certain populations have greater or lesser predisposition to specific traits based on allele frequencies alone

* Make clinical decisions without appropriate medical expertise and additional evidence

Misuse or misinterpretation of this data can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and lead to scientific conclusions that are not supported by evidence. Use of these data in ways that violate these terms of use will be reported to the relevant institutions and funding agencies (where applicable), and may result in the public naming of the individuals and organisations responsible for this misuse. We may also choose to block IP addresses associated with violations, acknowledging that this approach has substantial limitations.

### Guidelines for Responsible Use of the Data
The OurDNA Browser includes data that have been collected in partnership with communities whose genetic ancestries are underrepresented in genomics research. Community leaders have championed the program within their communities and advocated for community members’ participation to ensure their access to genomic advances. *We take community members’ entrustment of their data to us and our promise to deliver benefits to communities seriously*. We share these data with the expectation that they will be used in the spirit of the trust that communities have placed in CPG.

We encourage users to consider the following principles when working with the data:

* **Community benefit** - consider how your research will benefit OurDNA’s participating communities, either directly or indirectly

* **Ethical reflection** - consider how your research may be used by others and what impact this will have on communities

* **Contextual interpretation** - consider whether you have appropriately considered historical, social, and environmental contexts in how you have interpreted population genetic differences

* **Responsible reporting** - ensure that you are using appropriate terminology and framing that minimises the chance that your research will be misused

### Community Engagement

Community engagement and participation have been central to building the OurDNA Browser. We strongly encourage researchers to:

* Engage, consult, and partner with communities where relevant
* Consider accessible ways to disseminate their findings to communities
* Include community perspectives in research whenever suitable

## Open Access Policy

Open science is transparent and accessible knowledge that is shared and developed through collaborative networks.

The CPG is firmly committed to Open Science and maximising the community benefit of knowledge produced from the OurDNA project and other programs of work. This includes, but is not limited to, making aggregate data available, making code open-source, posting pre-prints, and prioritising publishing in journals that support open access to support engagement, which make it easier to publish, access and communicate scientific knowledge more broadly. By doing so, CPG supports equitable participation and access to data and data processing infrastructures for low and middle income countries.
