## OurDNA Browser Ethics Policy

Data included in the OurDNA Browser database has received rigorous ethical review and approval, guided by the principles of the [National Statement on ethical conduct in human research](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/about-us/publications/national-statement-ethical-conduct-human-research-2023) (‘National Statement’). The guidelines under the National Statement have been developed jointly by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), the Australian Research Council (ARC) and Universities Australia.

The ARC, NHMRC and Universities Australia have also developed a supplementary guide designed to support institutions and researchers to implement and comply with the National Statement, including the [Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/about-us/publications/australian-code-responsible-conduct-research-2018). All data generation, analysis and aggregation Is conducted in accordance with participants’ consent choices.

## Expectations For Data Use

### CPG’s Core Value 

We invite users to share in the core CPG value: We remember that our data comes from people. We aim to centre community interests in all uses of the data. Read more about how communities have participated in the building of the OurDNA Browser.

### CPG’s Commitment to Communities

The OurDNA Browser includes data that have been collected in partnership with communities whose genetic ancestries are underrepresented in genomics research. Community leaders have championed the program within their communities and advocated for community members’ participation to ensure their access to genomic advances. We take community members’ entrustment of their data to us and our promise to deliver benefits to communities seriously. We share these data with the expectation that they will be used in the spirit of the trust that communities have placed in CPG.

### Guidelines for responsible use of the data:

We encourage users to consider the following principles when working with the data:

- **Community benefit** - consider how your research will benefit OurDNA’s participating communities, either directly or indirectly

- **Ethical reflection** - consider how your research may be used by others and what impact this will have on communities  

- **Contextual interpretation** - consider whether you have appropriately considered historical, social, and environmental contexts in how you have interpreted population genetic differences

- **Responsible reporting** - ensure that you are using appropriate terminology and framing that minimises the chance that your research will be misused  


Data on genetic variation in diverse ancestry groups have been misused in the past for ideological reasons. We provide guidance on appropriate uses of the data and on reducing the likelihood of your research being misused. 

### Community Engagement

Community engagement and participation have been central to building the OurDNA Browser. We strongly encourage researchers to:

- Engage, consult, and partner with communities where relevant
- Consider accessible ways to disseminate their findings to communities
- Include community perspectives in research whenever suitable

[You can find resources on how to do this here.](https://populationgenomics.org.au/about-us/resources/publications/)


### Re-identification

It is prohibited to make any attempt to identify individual research participants from whom the data were obtained. Use of these data in ways that violate the Terms of Use, including through attempts at reidentification, will result in public naming of the individuals responsible for this misuse and their associated organisations.


## Open Access Policy

Open science is transparent and accessible knowledge that is shared and developed through collaborative networks.

The CPG is firmly committed to Open Science and maximising the community benefit of knowledge produced from the OurDNA project and other programmes of work. This includes, but is not limited to, making aggregate data available, code open-source, posting pre-prints, and prioritising publishing in journals that support open access to support engagement, making it easier to publish, access and communicate scientific knowledge more broadly. By doing so, CPG supports equitable participation and access to data and data processing infrastructures for low and middle income countries.


## Licence

The OurDNA aggregate data is available free under the [Creative Commons BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en). We request that you actively acknowledge and give attribution to the CPG with appropriate credit linking back to the project’s page. We also request that you provide a link to the licence, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the CPG endorses you or your use. If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same licence as the original. Attribution supports future efforts to release other data. It also reduces the amount of "orphaned data", helping retain links to authoritative sources.
